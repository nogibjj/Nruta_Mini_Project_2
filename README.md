# IDS 706 Week 2 Mini Project - Pandas Descriptive Statistics Script

### üèóÔ∏è Requirements
- Python script using Pandas for descriptive statistics
- Read a dataset (CSV or Excel)
- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Create at least one data visualization

### üìä Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is Sustainable Fashion: Eco-Friendly Trends from Kaggle. It provides information on sustainable fashion trends with various metrics related to the industry. For more details and to download the dataset, visit this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/sustainable-fashion-eco-friendly-trends).

- Eco_Friendly_Materials - whether the materials were eco-friendly or not
- Carbon_Footprint_MT - the carbon footprint generated in metric tonnes
- Water_Usage_Liters - the amount of water used in liters
- Waste_Production_KG - the amount of waste produced in kilograms
- Recycling_Programs - whether the brand had any recycling programs or not
- Product_lines - number of product lines the brand had

```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python sustainable_fashion.py
```

3. Generate Markdown and visualizations:

- The output summary statistics will be saved in `sustainable_fashion.md`.
- Visualizations (bar chart and pie chart) will be saved as `bar_plot.png` and `pie_chart.png`.

### üì¶ Installation
Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed. To install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib tabulate
```

### üß™ Testing
You can run the script and test the output with the dataset provided. To check the correctness of the statistics and visualizations, run:

```bash
make test
```

### üìä Output
After running the script, you will see:

- Summary statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, std deviation).
- Bar chart and pie chart visualizations saved in the root folder.

### üîç Visualizations
The script generates two visualizations:

1. Bar Chart - Displays the number of sustainable fashion brands by the countries.
2. Pie Chart - Shows the propotion of brands based on the materials they use.
